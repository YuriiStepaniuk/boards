## Running the Project with Docker

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

‚ö†Ô∏è Setup Environment Variables
Before starting, create and configure .env files in the project root and/or in the apps/server and apps/client folders as needed.
You can use the provided .env.example files as a template and fill in your own values.

1. In the project root, run:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

This will start:

PostgreSQL database (container named postgres)

Backend server (container named myserver)

Frontend React app (container named myclient)

2. Access the frontend app at http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port you expose).

3. Backend API runs at http://localhost:3001 (or your configured backend port).
